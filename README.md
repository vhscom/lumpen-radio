## Getting started

Looking to build your own React Native project with ES6/7? Check out my [React Native Starter Kit](https://github.com/vhs/react-native-webpack-starter-kit). Otherwise proceed enthusiastically.

1. Clone this project.
2. Install dependencies.

    ```sh
    npm install
    pod install
    ```

3. Run `npm start` to start the Webpack watcher, Webpack Dev Server and the React Packager in a single shot.

   **Note:** The Webpack watcher builds the `index.[platform].js` file expected by React Native.

4. Open `WLPN.xcworkspace` in XCode and run the project.

## Bundling for distribution

1. Execute `npm run bundle` to generate the [offline JS bundle](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device-ios.html#using-offline-bundle).
2. For iOS, update `AppDelegate.m` to load from pre-bundled file on disk.
3. Test the application, create an archive and submit to the store.

## Todo

- [x] Add background playback support
- [x] Show progress for initial connection
- [x] Indicate progress for long-running ops
- [x] Allow audio disruption for calls, etc.
- [x] Automatically reconnect if disconnected
- [x] Icon long-press restarts stream
- [x] Support Control Center / Remote Control events (thanks to Wayne Wright for the suggestion)
