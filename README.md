## Getting started

1. Clone this project.
2. Install dependencies.

    ```sh
    pod install
    npm install
    ```

    If you run into problems with the Pod installation please review [CocoaPods Troubleshooting](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/troubleshooting.html) and pay special attetion to any error messages received during the Pod installation.

3. Run `npm start` to start the Webpack watcher and the React Packager in a single shot.

   **Note:** The Webpack watcher builds the `index.ios.js` file expected by React Native.

4. Open `WLPN.xcworkspace` in XCode and run the project.

## Digging in

To learn more about React Native and how this app is built check out the video from the talk given to the React group in Chicago on [30 Jun 2015](https://www.meetup.com/React-Chicago/events/222510246/) and the [accompanying slide deck](https://slides.com/vhs/streaming-audio-react-native).
